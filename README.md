# Dynamic Programming

This repo contains all of my TypeScript code that I've written and practiced while learning Graph Algorithms.

## Usage

You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with npm) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/dipshanadh/graph-algorithms.git
cd ./graph-algorithms

npm install
npx ts-node <filename>
```
